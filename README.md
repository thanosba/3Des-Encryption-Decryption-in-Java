# Triple Des-Encryption-Decryption-in-Java


The Triple DES (also known as 3DES ) is an algorithm of encryption symmetric block, concatenating three successive applications of the algorithm DES on the same 64 data block bits , with 2 or 3 keys different.This use of three DES digits was developed by Walter Tuchman (DES project manager at IBM ), there are indeed other ways of using three DESs but they are not necessarily safe. The version of Tuchman uses an encryption, followed by a decryption to conclude again by an encryption.  The Triple DES is generally used with only two different keys. The standard mode of use is to use it in EDE mode ( Encryption, Decryption, Encryption , ie Encryption, Decryption, Encryption ) which makes it compatible with DES when using the same key three times.
